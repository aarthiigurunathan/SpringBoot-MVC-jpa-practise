PoC 1,2

1. Can you guys please do POC using all REST mapping... communicate with DB like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE. Exposed as rest endpoints, use swagger
2. Create another GET, POST endpoint.. and try to consume that in the existing POC ( means communication between one microservices to another microservice )
